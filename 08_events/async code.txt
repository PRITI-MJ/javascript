//async code

Javascript => 1. synchronus(code executed one by one)
              2. Single Threaded 

Execution Context => Execute one line of code at a time
like:-
console log 1
console log 2
 
Here, each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing



Blocking code vs Non-Blocking code

Blocking code => Block the flow of program => Read File synchronus

Non-Blocking code => Does not block execution => Read file async
